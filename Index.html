            <h1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
            <h3>Game Cocept</h3>
           
            <p>This is a Maze runner 3d game, in which the player will run for his life through a maze, different obstacles will come in its way but we have to reach the exit point before the exit gate closes. So, this is a level-based game.
            The idea came from the movie, the Maze Runner, where a group of people is stranded on a piece of land. The only way out is through a maze. Every morning the gates for the maze opens and closes when the night comes. So, the runner either have to get to the exit or get back before the gate closes. Because if someone is left outside the gate at night. He never returns alive.

            This project has huge scope. If time permits, the villain Machines can also be added to the game, that will come out at night if we are left outside the gates before night. The battle will be at most difficulty.
